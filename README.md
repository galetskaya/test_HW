**This file contains the information about the program.**

The goal of the program is to **_accept a string massive any length and if any element of it is less or equal to 3, print this one in a new string massive_**.

My program requests a size of a future massive from the user, then user can enter elements via comma, corresponding to the size he enetered before.

The logic takes every element of the original massive and if its length less or equal to 3, program write down the value to the new massive, if no - switch to the next element.

Then, print the new massive with all results which do correspond to the task condition.
